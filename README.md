# Higgs Challenge

Higgs Boson particle identification using machine learning project for the EPFL Machine Learning course. The problem was 
orinally proposed by CERN as a Kaggle challenge using a 250 000 samples dataset recorded by the research center. 

In this repo you will find the solution proposed by my team for this challenge
